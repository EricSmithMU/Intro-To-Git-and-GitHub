# Intro to Git and GitHub
By: Eric Smith

This tutorial will help new incoming freshman in college become familar with GitHub. This is a very simple tutorial with only a few steps. It will help get freshman on their feet in a new environment of learning and coding.

# What is Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

…every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. [Git(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

The Git version control system functionality is available at the command line in macOS and is also available through the user interface in many integrated development environments. Typically the command line and functionality in an IDE are both used in development. In this course, you are going to first learn how to manage a project using Git/GitHub on the command line. Later you will learn how to use an IDE’s version control user interface.

Every software engineer needs to learn how to use Git. Although there are [other version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software), Git is currently one of the most utilized.

# What is GitHub?

You could use Git on your standalone computer to manage some aspects of version control, but you would be missing some abilities that can only be obtained using a Git server such as collaboration and having a copy of the repository stored remotely for backup.

GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

GitHub is not the only Git hosting available. Another host is [Bitbucket from Atlassian](https://bitbucket.org/). But, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular and well known Git hosting service.

# Using Git/GitHub at the Command Line

The following documents provide the process I use with Git and GitHub at the command line. The Condensed version of the document leaves out most of the explanations and just shows the steps.

# Advice

If you are already a Git/GitHub user, great! Keep working to refine your Git and GitHub skills and knowledge. Knowledge is power, so keep improving! A software engineer is expected to be knowledgeable and experienced with version control and specifically Git/GitHub.

If you are learning to use Git and GitHub:

  - Don’t avoid learning how to use Git and GitHub. It may seem confusing or difficult at the start, but once you gain some experience it will make sense and you     will wonder how you ever worked without it or why it seemed difficult at first.
  - The only real way to learn is by doing! Experience/practice makes things understandable. Don’t avoid using Git/GitHub or attempt to not use them and then         create a repository just to submit your work. Embrace the fact that you need to learn how to use them. You will be better off with all of your development       work once you use version control and VCS hosting.
  - Don’t avoid learning how to use Git/GitHub on the command line. There are things you can’t do and problems you can’t solve using only the GUI in an IDE.
  - Don’t wait for a large, collaborative project before learning how to use Git and GitHub.
  - Git/GitHub is useful for managing files for projects other than software development projects.
